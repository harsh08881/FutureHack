In the times when everything is about speed and efficiency, when we are talking about Quantum computing - traditional banks seem like dinosaurs - they are big, slow-moving, and inefficient (costs, time-to-market, slow to innovate). However, banks have a tremendous amount of data, deep financial and regulatory knowledge, and relationships. 
Traditionally banks have enjoyed the monopoly on consumer data - which for consumers has implied fewer/few options for their banking and in terms of financial tools. However, things are starting to change with introduction of regulations like, SEPA, PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2), GDPR, and XS2A etc. are pushing banks to be more transparent, open, collaborative, secure, and innovative. Though PSD2 is a European directive to advance the design of more secure/safer and innovative payment systems and services - it is the competition and access to data aspect that will eventually drive banks across the world to similar model.
“One of the main features of the directive is that PSD2 applies beyond traditional banking. The regulation also acknowledges and regulates third-party providers (TPPs) like fintech app developers and merchants [like Amazon etc.]. These providers are now allowed to access user bank account data, aggregate accounts, and initiate payments (with the consumer’s permission, of course). In fact, as part of PSD2, banks are required to grant this access to TPPs.”
This aspect of 3rd party access and opening up the banks to competition, leads (hopefully) banks to be more competitive - this is really good for the consumers because the market opens up for more options/products/services for consumers to choose from; Open Banking is all about that.
Technologies like AI, Blockchain, and IoT will continue to evolve and give rise to new and innovative business models, products, and services - and hence even more disruption around the financial ecosystem - banks and the insurance industry. 
How can banks remain competitive with such operational overhead, legacy systems, and business models (not open to partnerships/innovation, etc) ? Does simply having APIs lead to innovation? Can modern technologies without sound strategies lead to success? 
For the Open Banking strategy to work for banks, they will need a well-thought-of Open Innovation strategy.
### Open Banking
The purpose behind all these standards and regulations is to address two fundamental concerns:
1.	Data ownership: Banks may hold the data, but the data belongs to the customer.
2.	Monopoly: Monopoly kills innovation, leads to unfair advantage, and restricts consumer options.
“there are over 4 million people who can't get access to credit open banking can help solve that by allowing them to use their transaction data to create bespoke credit reports two million people in this country get ripped off on overdraft fee's open banking can help that by enabling fintechs to unbundle overdrafts for consumers two million people approximately get a very bad deal on savings they've got high balances and current accounts that are earning zero interest open banking can help them switch to higher paying accounts more easily twelve million of us are on the wrong financial services product maybe it's a mortgage maybe it's a credit card I don't know but open banking can help move people to the right products four million people within the UK are on debt repayment plans dumb debt repayment plans they're enslaved to for seven years with open banking they can use their transaction data in the hands of the right intermediary in order to create smart repayment plans and help them get back to to where they need to be…” - Imran Gulamhuseinwala: Why Open Banking is the Future of Fintech
Open banking is thus all about increasing consumer choices (smarter, efficient, cheaper, etc.) and opening up the financial services playing field for innovation. 
From a technology perspective, three fundamental building blocks are security, privacy, and consent - enabled through APIs.

### The benefits are three-fold for the banks:
1.	Compliance with regulations 
2.	Agility by optimizing technology and processes to be able to work with FinTechs and other 3rd parties 
3.	With right strategy (Open Innovation), tapping into external opportunities and partnership to co-create and/or co-develop - this can potentially lead to faster time-to-market and/or new products and services.

### From strategy perspective, banks will have two options available to them 
1.	Just do enough to meet regulatory requirements<br>
2.	Embrace the Open Banking and be innovators - because it will shape your strategy, since you could simply remain focused on just doing just enough to comply with regulations, or you could get serious about “open innovation” and allow the ideas to be generated within and outside the boundaries of your enterprise. 
I strongly believe that Open Innovation is the way forward for Open Banking; thus Banks that strategically want to embrace the Open Banking must make it part of “Open Innovation” (OI) if they already have that as a broader strategy, and if they don’t already have OI - then it is good time to seriously making it part of their DNA.
Open Banking is shift in mindset because it is model that relies on enterprise boundaries to be permeable for ideas and information flow through the boundaries of the enterprise. Moreover, it is about co-creating/co-designing with startups and other businesses. 
Susan French SVP, Head of Product, BBVA Open Platform, explains the reality of this new business model
“Fintechs that are offering services to primarily millennial populations to help them better manage their financial life for example one of our clients called Digit - Digit customers sign up with the digit app they give digit permission to digit app they give digit permission to access their existing bank accounts Digit has proprietary algorithms that are able to identify slices of time when it's safe for $10 $20 to be siphoned out and set aside toward whatever savings goal and so all this kind of happens magically for them all I have to do is give you permission to look at my incoming and outgoing finances and magically money is siphoned off and saved…”
### and on challenges of Open Innovation
“I think that's a question on the minds of everybody, that is at what point do you cede certain aspects of your customers financial life to fintechs or how often do you try to build out complimentary services and retain that stickiness to your brand, I think the answer is going to be in the future so a mixture of both there are going to be some services that that a BBVA customer will expect from BBVA with the BPA's name on it and there are going to be other services that they will get from other providers which we may support and a mixture of those is what's going to make their financial life successful…”
Open Innovation (OI)
OI is a big topic and there are quite a few books and articles on it - so I will discuss it briefly here. According to Wikipedia 
“Open innovation is a term used to promote an information age mindset toward innovation that runs counter to the secrecy and silo mentality of traditional corporate research labs. The benefits and driving forces behind increased openness have been noted and discussed as far back as the 1960s, especially as it pertains to inter-firm cooperation in R&D. Use of the term 'open innovation' in reference to the increasing embrace of external cooperation in a complex world has been promoted in particular by Henry Chesbrough, adjunct professor and faculty director of the Center for Open Innovation of the Haas School of Business at the University of California.”
 
### In a blog post, Henry Chesbrough shared the following
"Conceptually, it is a more distributed, more participatory, more decentralized approach to innovation, based on the observed fact that useful knowledge today is widely distributed, and no company, no matter how capable or how big, could innovate effectively on its own. Yet at the same time, there is a critical role for an overarching architecture that connects these seemingly disparate activities together. And the business model (which itself can be innovated) determines what companies look to bring inside the firm and allow to go outside the firm." 
and
“How do you know what to look for outside, and what to let go to the outside? Your business model determines the answer to these questions. You look for ideas and technologies that fit with your business model. And your internal ideas and technologies that don’t fit are logical candidates to go to the outside. So the business model is another key element of the open innovation concept.”
When we hear the words/terms like “Innovation” our first reaction is “technology” and/or “R&D” - yet, innovation is also a social activity that requires interaction, participation, and collaboration of various departments, like, Marketing, Technology, Finance, Security, and HR etc. 
OI implies that enterprises will have to manage both internal and external information flows and relationships and to have well defined structure, scope, policies, and governance. External parties could be government, institutions, merchants, startups, etc.
The advantages of OI are numerous if led/managed/run properly - crucially it is about getting ideas from within and outside the enterprise and them into products/services and partnerships for competitive advantage.
 
To initiate OI within an enterprise, make sure that it has strong cross-enterprise representation from within the enterprise - and that it is not run as a YAS (yet another silo), but rather allows diverse internal and external minds to work together.
Stefan Lindegaard has recommended Seven Steps for Open Innovation
1. Common Language and Understanding, Motivation, Mandate and Strategic Purpose
2. Assets and Needs
3. Value Pools and Channels
4. Internal Readiness
5. External Readiness
6. New Skills and Mindset
7. Communication Strategy
Message across the enterprise should be clear - as to what is OI, why it is important, and how it is going to be part of the culture - and how it will be part of the vision of the enterprise.
Like with anything else, there are challenges with OI and you have to be mindful of those - Banks are highly regulated environments and thus working on innovative new products and services may potentially impact existing regulations or perhaps require new policies or modifications to existing policies (of course if that makes sense) - from OI perspective, regulatory bodies can be seen as partners who can work with you in a sandbox environment; 
as Professor Henry Chesbrough discusses here
"Standard Chartered Bank has done with some success they've created a design studio here in San Francisco and they have brought regulators from Singapore to the design studio to show them subtleties that are emerging in the banking industry with a goal of trying to inform the regulators and work with the regulator's to say so what are the right ways to approach this and one of the constructs that came out of this was the idea of a sandbox where you create a space where you have a lot of freedom to experiment but it's managed as a sandbox so there are careful boundaries around it and the industry agrees to remain in the sandbox for the current period of time so that they and the regulator's can explore this together before taking it out to the wider society" 
Platforms
Platform thinking helps enterprises align their strategies around business, technology, assets, partners, and consumers; without platform-thinking enterprises end-up with isolated strategies and then try to link them, only to fail at it because dysfunction of silos sinks in. Platform-thinking is about enablement and wins for all participants and collaborators.
Amazon has proven that Platforms are very powerful - who would have imagined that an online bookstore will be one of the most powerful and disruptive company!! - that is the power of platforms. It is important for business and technology leaders to realize that Platform is not just about technology, and Google+ is a good reminder to us. 
Platforms = Platform Thinking + Platform Business/Economic Model + Assets + Technology Stack + API strategy
Assets: Data (information, Knowledge), Relationships, Infrastructure, Systems.
Participants: Platform Owner(s), Customers/Consumers, Sellers/Partners etc.
Experience: Channel Ubiquity, Digital, Developer Experience, Communities
Stack: Flexible/Modular Architecture, Real-Time decision, Automation/DevOps, APIs
Strategies: Ecosystems, Aggregations, Market Places, Shared-economies, Open Innovation, Digital Platform etc.
Steve Yegge in a rant, around 11 years ago - shared some nuggets around the power of Platforms:
1. You wouldn't really think that an online bookstore needs to be an extensible, programmable platform. Would you?
2. The Golden Rule of Platforms, "Eat Your Own Dog-food", can be rephrased as "Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything." You can't just bolt it on later. Certainly not easily at any rate
3. A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.
4. Wave was a great platform, may they rest in peace. But making something a platform is not going to make you an instant success. A platform needs a killer app. Facebook -- that is, the stock service they offer with walls and friends and such -- is the killer app for the Facebook Platform. And it is a very serious mistake to conclude that the Facebook App could have been anywhere near as successful without the Facebook Platform.
Though originally published on Google+ you can still read it here
BBVA Open Banking Platform
Lets see how BBVA a bank known for digital transformation, uses the power of Platform - as per Steve Yegge's points:
a. "Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything."
b. A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.
 
Carlos López-Moctezuma, BBVA’s Global Head of Open Banking, shares strategic advantages of their Open Banking strategy and power of Platforms:
“BBVA’s Open Banking aims to reach other platforms where its clients are already operating…he recently launched partnership between BBVA and Uber in Mexico to launch banking products on the Uber platform was a great example of open banking in action… Uber’s driver-partners and delivery partners can now create a digital account linked to the international debit card ‘Tarjeta Socio Conductor’, using Uber’s app without having to access the bank’s App. With this new service, Uber’s driver-partners can receive their income directly in just a few minutes, and access a platform for financial benefits, such as loans, as well as non-financial benefits, including discounts and refunds for purchases at gas stations with the new card”
APIs
Everyone understands the importance of APIs in terms of Open Banking – that’s how you expose and consume services. However, many enterprises lack a serious business strategy for their APIs. APIs are mistakenly seen just as an "integration service" and hence the strategic focus is on tooling alone. Since APIs are seen just as a technology solution to system integration and for that reason LoB leaders don’t get the importance of treating APIs as “Products” - and thus consider the strategic value of the well-designed APIs and their lifecycle. 
Strategy: Marketplace, Monetization
Access: Public, Private, and Partner APIs
Experience: Developer, Partner, Consumer, and Communities
Interoperability: Open Standards, Open APIs
Tooling: Gateway, Metering, Publishing, Discovery, Registry, Security, Offline-testing, etc.
Here is a nice slide on API monetization from Christian Loveras's presentation on Open Banking
 
Here are some examples of how various startups and banks are using APIs
 
### API Design Consideration: 
There is a lot of material on the design of APIs on the internet, so there is not much point repeating it - but just to highlight that, you need to consider three important aspects:
1.	It is all about “Experience” - Your APIs are designed for someone else to use, so keep the design from the consumer’s point of view. Your policies around versioning, backward compatibility, and security policies will have a significant impact on the consumer experience of your APIs.
Consider following DDD concepts for your API design
•	 Subdomain (problem space)
•	 Bounded Context (solution space)
•	 Domain Experts
•	 Ubiquitous Language (common language that describes the domain, and is understood by everyone - use to define nouns and verbs for your APIs)  
2. Open Standards - for better/easier interoperability
... and finally, there is a very nice right-up "API Maturity for Humans" by Chris Wood - that I would highly recommend:

### Conclusion
Change is inevitable and change is coming - the forces of change will be new technologies, regulations, new business models, changing behaviors, etc. Banks and Insurance will have no way out of sharing the data with TPP (with the consumer’s consent). 
In such a highly dynamic and rapidly changing environment it will be difficult for large banks/insurance companies to remain competitive - unless they transform to function like scaled-up startups and adopt an open innovation model; because taking upon everything upon themselves will not be as efficient as partnerships where leveraging each other’s strength can lead new innovative products and services. Some of this will come down to better integrations, and some of it will be co-design/co-development. Open Innovation allows enterprises to tap into cognitive diversity, expertise, cost-effectiveness, and agility.
Most large banks and insurance companies remain very reactive to the change - moving forward they should not only be investing in products of today but also invest in designing for the future. In the connected world of tomorrow majority of the transaction will be done by and through machines, devices, and software - the expectation in such a world will be ambient experience, speed, and efficiency. 
Imagine the world as depicted below - and ask yourself
 
Are you ready for it? How this will impact existing business models, create new business opportunities, new business models, and new partnerships? do you have the strategies in place? does your team have the cognitive diversity? do you have the agility? do you have the partnerships? - What do you see when you walk from future back to present!!
